## Project Overview:
This was an academic project. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

## Dataset
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with the 
minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem 
(recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google 
Street View images.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:**  CV2, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, flask, tensorflow, Keras.

## Project Overview
* Read the data from the h5py file
* Reshaped and normalized the data.
* Defined the model architecture using algorithm to try different combination of layers and cells.
* Compiled the model with loss as categorical cross-entropy and adam optimizers. Used accuracy as the 
metric for evaluation
